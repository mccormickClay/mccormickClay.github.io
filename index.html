 <h2> Start Here </h2>
  <p class="indent"> Hey there, as a Gameplay Programmer from Depaul University, I have worked on multiple different
      ideas for games and other programs. Along with Programming with C, C++, C# and Java, I've also worked in Maya
    for 3D models and animations. Before this career I wanted to do something with Art and Design, so I was thrown into the
      gaming force with Game Design at my Community college.  </p>
	<h2> Current Education </h2>
        <p class="indent"> BS in Computer Game Development thought DePaul University</p>
        <p class="indent2">Concentration in Gameplay Programming</p>
        <p class="indent2"> Minor in Animation</p>
        <p class="indent"> AAS in Game Design and Development through Joliet Junior College</p>
        <p class="indent2"> Concentration in Programming</p>
    <h2>Constant Growth</h2>
        <p class="indent"> I am working on projects as much as i can to continue learning what can make optimal code. In the Blog Section,
        I will be commenting on current works along with old projects to showcase work and my thought process.</p>
