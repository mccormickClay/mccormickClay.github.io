  <p class="indent"> Hey there, as a Gameplay Programmer from Depaul University, I have worked on multiple different
ideas for games and other programs. Along with Programming with C, C++ and Java, I also understand and can use Maya
for 3D models and animations. Before this career I wanted to do something with Art and Design, so I was thrown into the
gaming force with Game Design at my Community college.  </p>
