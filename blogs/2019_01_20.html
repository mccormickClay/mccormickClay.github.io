	<p>
    Inside Project Lantern the player is allowed to interact with
    specific objects within the game. These objects interact in Unity
    by Trigger Colliders. The interactions would be simple, the ability
    to pick up torches and melting ice with it.
	</p>
      
    <p> The first run through was adding an if for the first couple interactable objects.
            I was able to prototype the functions working as they were supposed to. The player held 
            two GameObjects always that changed based on the Trigger the player was entering.
            They were specifically for what the player was holding and colliding with. My reasoning
            was to allow the player the choice to interact with the object whenever they were in
            the trigger area and know what object they were colliding with. Depending if the player
            had a torch or not, was where all the ifs came in.</p>

    <p>As we went through the design process it became clear that there would be more than a couple
    of interactable objects. I was going to have to redo the system to make this easier for myself
    and for future implementations. I wanted to avoid as many ifs as possible. With my current system, I use
    one if, and that is only inside specific objects made by the Designers in Scene Mode. With the due date 
    coming near, I need to make sure I have everything working for the designers even if there an if I’d rather remove.
    </p>

    <p>I ended up creating two base objects. One inherited MonoBehavior and the other does not.
    InteractableObjectBase was created so that the designers would have choices for their objects if needed in SceneMode 
    in something they are comfortable with. InteractableCommandBase is the abstract base class derived from Component for anything 
    that will interact with one another. Inside the command base, i create abstract functions for Interact(), Accept() and Visit(). 
    The visitor pattern is used to allow the interactable objects knowledge of what they are talking to starting from 
    the CommandBase. With the player’s CommandBase (either a torch or null command), they can interact with any GameObject 
    that has a trigger, retrieve its base. I created a public static class that when knowing both derived classed will tell 
    the first object to interact with the other.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mccormickClay/aa88c6ea50c01c98ec30976bc207ab7b.js"></script>
    
    <p>The downside to this process is that each trigger that the player interacts with needs to have this command. However, having 
    the null command can fix this problem easily. This also cancels the need to have ifs or the player to hold multiple GameObjects. 
    Now it only holds two commands (held and colliding command).
    </p>

    <p>Even with the overhead of needing functions for every interaction, it allows a lot of customization that was not possible before. 
    A very basic example is the ability not to grab multiple torches or drop a torch when you are already colliding with one. Adding 
    colliding objects with independent code is simple and allows specific interactions with each object (blessing and a curse). 
    Hopefully, this will be put to the test and I can see how to slowly improve on it.
