      <p>LANTERNS will be a single player experience where you play as a soul lost in a cave without their
        bright light to help it. Soul will face challenges and puzzles to make it back to their former selves.</p>
        <h4>Follow the news...</h4>
        <p> This will be the first game I will catelog and record the process to explain the thought behind code
        and design. Be sure to keep up in the blog!</p>

		<header class="blogHeader1"><h2>Ramen</h2></header>
	<div class = "card-container1">
	  <h4>3D Game Engine</h4>
      <p>Ramen is a basic game engine worked on from a backend that controlled the graphics card in OpenGL.
        Within the engine I made I worked on a objective tank game to destroy enemies and collect objects or power ups.
        The Engine has a Terrain manager and creator along with the ability to have sprite, alarms, collision and a keylogger
          replying and debugging. Some blogs might bring up Ramen as an example.</p>
        <p>Here is some code from the Engine LINK HERE</p>

        <header class="blogHeader1"><h2>Centipede</h2></header>
	<div class = "card-container1">
	  <h4>Trying to make a near perfect replica</h4>
      <p>The point of working on Centipede was to show the difficulty of programming without exact knowledge
        of Design Patterns. This was the first steps in using Singletons, Flyweight and Command patterns in C++.
        At the end we needed to have a near identical game given to us for a resource without any errors.</p>
        <p>Here is some code from Centipede LINK HERE</p>

          <header class="blogHeader1"><h2>Tonal Shift</h2></header>
	<div class = "card-container1">
	  <h4>Trying to make a near perfect replica</h4>
      <p>Tonal Shift was the winner of the 2016 Game Jam during the winter in DePaul. It uses Unity and C# to control the players voice
        to move the floor for a ball to move. The pitch used will move rectangles upward to change the movement of the ball to avoid obstacles.
        I worked specifically on the level design, environment, and the scripts for color changing and the amount of volume needed to control 
        the ractangles.</p>
