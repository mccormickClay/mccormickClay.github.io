      <p>LANTERNS will be a single player experience where you play as a character who just lost a important
        relationship in their life. The character must learn go to through puzzles without help of their companion.</p>
        <h4>Follow the news...</h4>
        <p> This will be the first game I will catelog and record the process to explain the thought behind code

	<div class = "card-container1">
	  <h4>(2018) 3D Game Engine</h4>
      <p>Ramen is a basic game engine worked on from a backend that controlled the graphics card in OpenGL.
        Within the engine I made I worked on a objective tank game to destroy enemies and collect objects or power ups.
        The Engine has a Terrain manager and creator along with the ability to have sprite, alarms, collision and a keylogger
          replying and debugging. Some blogs might bring up Ramen as an example.</p>

  <div class = "card-container1">
      <h4>(2018) Microsoft DX11</h4>
        <p>This was a final class project that showed the use of terrain generation with heightmaps, using shader scripts 
          and many others. Dealing with the terrain in a world of CCW vs CW was confusing but I am happy with the result.
        There is still a lot more I could do with this kind of application on other projects.</p>

	<div class = "card-container1">
	  <h4>(2017) Trying to make a near perfect replica</h4>
      <p>This was an attempt to make a replica of 1982 Atari Centipede. The point of working on 
        Centipede was to show the difficulty of programming without exact knowledge
        of Design Patterns. This was the first steps in using Singletons, Flyweight and Command patterns in C++.
        At the end we needed to have a near identical game given to us for a resource without any errors.</p>

	<div class = "card-container1">
	  <h4>(2016) Using voice to the world around a ball. Made in Unity</h4>
      <p>Tonal Shift was the winner of the 2016 Game Jam during the winter in DePaul. It uses Unity and C# to control the players voice
        to move the floor for a ball to move. The pitch used will move rectangles upward to change the movement of the ball to avoid obstacles.
        I worked specifically on the level design, environment, and the scripts for color changing and the amount of volume needed to control 
        the ractangles.</p>

  <header class="blogHeader1"><h2>MellowMallows (Gameplay Programmer)</h2></header>
	<div class = "card-container1">
	  <h4>(2016) Zen at its finest. Made in Unity</h4>
      <p>This is a game based on relaxing. There are no win lose scenarios. You toast marshmellows to your will. Brown, Gold or too a crisp.
        The choice is yours. This is my first game I created in Unity. I was rotating quaternions for arm movement and using a simplified lerp
        to make a more optimized color change.

  <header class="blogHeader1"><h2>Neon (Personal Project)</h2></header>
	<div class = "card-container1">
	  <h4>(2015) First time coding larger then 3-4 classes. Made in GameMaker 1.7</h4>
      <p>Neon is the first game and large project I ever worked on. This was created in 2015 and was a lot of problems with it.
        The greatest part of this is how power-ups change based on all them that are currently being used by the player. Certain
        combos mix together to make a deadly attack. This is basically a Geometry Wars clone I created for a game competition and won.
