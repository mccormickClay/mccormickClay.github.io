	  <h4>3D Game Engine</h4>
      <p>Ramen is a basic game engine worked on from a backend that controlled the graphics card in OpenGL.
        Within the engine I made I worked on a objective tank game to destroy enemies and collect objects or power ups.
        The Engine has a Terrain manager and creator along with the ability to have sprite, alarms, collision and a keylogger
          replying and debugging. Some blogs might bring up Ramen as an example.</p>
        <p>Here is some code from the Engine</p>
